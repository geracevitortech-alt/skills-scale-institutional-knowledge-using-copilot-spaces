# Risk Register Template

## Project Information
- **Project Name:**
- **Project Manager:**
- **Risk Manager:**
- **Last Updated:**

## Instructions
Use this template to identify, assess, and track risks throughout the project lifecycle. Update the risk register weekly during project syncs and whenever new risks are identified or risk status changes.

## Risk Categories
- **Technical:** Architecture, technology choices, dependencies, technical debt
- **Resource:** Team availability, skill gaps, budget constraints
- **Schedule:** Timeline risks, dependency delays, milestone slippage
- **Business:** Market changes, priority shifts, stakeholder alignment
- **External:** Third-party dependencies, regulatory, compliance
- **Quality:** Testing coverage, defect rates, technical debt

## Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Impact (H/M/L) | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Risk Score | Owner | Mitigation Plan | Status | Last Updated |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------:|-------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| R-001 | | | | | | | | | |
| R-002 | | | | | | | | | |
| R-003 | | | | | | | | | |
| R-004 | | | | | | | | | |
| R-005 | | | | | | | | | |

### Risk Scoring Guide
- **High Impact:** Could cause project failure, significant delays (>2 weeks), or major scope reduction
- **Medium Impact:** Could cause moderate delays (1-2 weeks) or scope adjustments
- **Low Impact:** Minor delays or adjustments, easily recoverable

- **High Likelihood:** Very likely to occur (>50% probability)
- **Medium Likelihood:** Possible to occur (20-50% probability)
- **Low Likelihood:** Unlikely to occur (<20% probability)

**Risk Score Calculation:**
- High/High = 9 (Critical - immediate action required)
- High/Medium or Medium/High = 6 (High priority)
- High/Low, Medium/Medium, or Low/High = 3-4 (Monitor closely)
- Medium/Low or Low/Medium = 2 (Track)
- Low/Low = 1 (Awareness only)

### Status Definitions
- **Identified:** Risk has been identified and documented
- **Assessing:** Impact and likelihood analysis in progress
- **Mitigating:** Mitigation plan is being executed
- **Monitoring:** Mitigation in place, monitoring for changes
- **Closed:** Risk no longer applicable or successfully mitigated
- **Realized:** Risk has occurred, incident response in progress

## Closed/Realized Risks
Track resolved or realized risks for retrospective analysis:

| Risk ID | Description | Resolution/Outcome | Closed Date | Lessons Learned |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| | | | | |

## Risk Review Schedule
- **Weekly Reviews:** Every [Day] during project sync
- **Monthly Deep Dives:** Review all risks, update assessments
- **Milestone Reviews:** Before each major milestone or release
- **Ad-hoc Reviews:** When significant project changes occur

## Escalation Path
- **Medium Risks:** Report to Project Manager weekly
- **High Risks:** Report to Project Manager and Product Lead immediately
- **Critical Risks:** Escalate to Sponsor and executive stakeholders within 24 hours
